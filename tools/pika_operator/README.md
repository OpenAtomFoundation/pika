# pika-operator

pika-operator is a Kubernetes operator for managing Pika.

## Description

This operator is responsible for managing the lifecycle of Pika.
It is responsible for creating and managing the following resources:

- StatefulSet
- Service
- PersistentVolumeClaim

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io)
or [KIND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever
cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running locally with MiniKube

1. Install [MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

2. Start a local cluster:

```sh
make minikube-up # run this if you don't have a minikube cluster
make local-deploy
```

Or if you want to use a development pika image:

```sh
make local-deploy PIKA_IMAGE=<your-pika-image>
```

If you see some message like the following, it means that the pika-operator is running successfully:

```sh
************  TEST PIKA ************
kubectl run pika-minikub-test ...
pika_version:3.5.0
pika_git_sha:bd30511bf82038c2c6531b3d84872c9825fe836a
pika_build_compile_date: Dec  1 2020
````

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/pika-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/pika-operator:tag
```

### Run Pika Instance

1. Create a Pika instance:

```sh
kubectl apply -f examples/pika-sample/
```

2. Check the status of the Pika instance:

```sh
kubectl get pika pika-sample
```

3. Connection to the Pika instance:

```sh
kubectl run pika-sample-test --image redis -it --rm --restart=Never \
  -- /usr/local/bin/redis-cli -h pika-sample -p 9221 info
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

This project is still in its early stages and contributions are welcome. Please feel free to open issues and PRs.
Please see this [issue](https://github.com/OpenAtomFoundation/pika/issues/1236) to discuss the design of the operator.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the
Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the
cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
